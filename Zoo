1) A new animal has come in, with the following details:
name - "Slim", type - "Giraffe", country_id - 1
Add him to the Animals table.
2) You want to make a complete list of the animals for the zooâ€™s visitors. 
Write a query to output a new table with each animal's name, type and country fields, sorted by countries.

/* name - "Slim", type - "Giraffe", country_id - 1 */


INSERT INTO Animals(name,type,country_id)
VALUES ('Slim','Giraffe','1');

SELECT Animals.name, Animals.type,Countries.country 
FROM Animals INNER JOIN Countries
ON Animals.country_id = Countries.id
ORDER BY Countries.country
